# Matchday App Hosting

This repository is the web resources for Matchday app. Initially, we had to construct this to go through the review process of the AdMob that requires `app-ads.txt` is placed in own server. In the future, we can move other web resources like Privacy Policy, etc to here.

Website: https://matchdaycalendar.netlify.app

## Netlify

It uses Netlify to host the web resources.

Netlify console: https://app.netlify.com/sites/matchdaycalendar/overview

## Deploy

As it has already configured integration between Netlify and GitHub, all you need to do is just commit to the remote repository. The changes will automatically be deployed to Netlify.
